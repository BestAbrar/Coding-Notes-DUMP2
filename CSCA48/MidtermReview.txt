1. need to add return memory box at end of z
bozes should be assigned from left to right by variable declaration order
	*it was okay if you put the ereturn at the very start or right after z, but not after 'O'
If you didn't do correct order, you were given part marks for correct values of z, correct type of variable
(but you WON'T get partial marks at all next time if it isn't in order

1 mark for correct variable and types
1 makr for correct final value of x
1 mark for correct values in word(marks weren't taken off if you forgot quotes this time)
1 mark for correct valu of z (which is '\0')
1 mark of 'O' in box 0603
Question 2:
Correct:a,e,f
Incorrect: b,c,d
Note for e
* Can't free a variable that isn't malloced or calloced (free(x) would cause memory problem!)
Question 3:
1 mark for calloc
1 mark for strcpy
1 mark for set n_books = 1
1 mark for type and copies
1 mark for loc
-1 for the_book"->"
Question 4:a
Question 5:
1 mark for doing some kind of check that b-> the_book.copies <=1
1 mark for dynamically allocating a new node within your loop
Question 6:
1 makr for dicription of worst case senario
1 mark for stating how each CS books should be checked with each biobook resulting in O(n^2)
 * must specify that CS linked list and BS linked list have n/2 elements
Question 7
3 marks for correct complexit O(N)
2 marks for explination
 * 1 mark for describeing the process of checkeing each CS book with c Bio books
 * 1 mark for stating c<<N and it is constant so we write O(cN)=O(N)
Question 8
part 1 O(mn)
part 2 O(m) 2 marks
	O(1 point for explination) Since author's list can have up to M members, we need to traverse author's list once
part 3 O(NM^2) or O(M^2N^2) or O(M^2N^2) if given a sufficient explination

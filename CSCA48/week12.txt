Object oriented programing
How will other programs interact with our module
* how to set up an interface
Which functions to make available to the user
what is the difference between module, library and API
Module only has a single functionality (complex numbers)
Library -> multiple modules
API (application programing interface) -> how to use library, documentation

How to write APIs in C
what we will discoveredSome missing concepts in C
Indroduction to concepts in Object oriented programming OOPs
What we will not discovered
*C++ Syntax
keep note of the concepts
inheritance
polymorphism
modules reason for including guards

C features
two related tasks:
privide way to specify actions to be exicuted by the machine (requires a
language that is close to the machine)

low - level language with high level features
-C is a minimal language that is closer to low level language

What is missing in C
C provides no way to hide or protect sensitive data from being misused or accessed in a way
that was not intended by us when we developed the module
Dificult to wrap data and functions for that

Stack ADT
LIFO (last in-first out)-where last command added (push) to stack is the first exicuted (pop)
PRIMARY functions
Stack() creates a new empty Stack
push() push item ontop of Stack
pop() removes top item form the Stack
peek() returns the top item from stack but doesn't remove it
HELPER functions
isEmpty() returns if stack is empty or not
isFull() returns if the stack is at capacity or not
size() returns the number of items present in the Stack

Never add struct data type into .h files, always in the implementation .c file
declaration is in .h file

Opaque data type-are considered opaque because we don't know how the data of the
file is stored/organized

OOP
Uses incapsulaiton to protect information
C with classes = C++
classes= data +code -> user defined data type
objects= instance of class -> variables

other feature OOP offers
  *abstraction
  class
  Object
  Encapsulation
  inheritance
  Polymorphism- object takes
C++ is a more high level language than C
abstraction -Extracting out the essential characteristics of a Thing
access modifiers = public, private, protected
variables are technically considered objects
Access modifiers
inside access modifiers can be data as well as functions
public-some function that belongs to a class
private- only visible within the class
protected-visible to functions inside the class and classes derived from said class
Constructor- a function that is called when new instance of class is being called
  - ensures that objects always have valid data to work with
  - sets initial value of objects
Destructor- job is to release memory and close files
destructor- runs automatically at the end of a function unless specified otherwise
object-instance of a class
(CLASS) name_of_object -> how we create a object
can't have the same function name twice
Method overloading with constructors
can have the same method name that pass different parameters
inheritance
derived class, inherits the data and methods from the base class, derived classes can have
additional classes
2 benitifs
  1. Reuse- can use the methods in the base class for multiple derived classes, you can further
  change multiple derived classes by doing a single change to the base class
  2. abstraction information hiding-some methods in the base class are not accessable to the derived
  class
inheritance bad design
  -multiple base classes with only one derived class
  -single base class and single derived class
  -base class and multiple derived classes
    -in series or parallel, note in series base class is considered a class that doesn't derive
    any classes
classes inherited privatly will always be private, when inheritance isn't mentioned
take note of what is a bad design and what is a good design for inheritance
<T> means template, working on anything that isn't primitive type
Avoid deep inheritance trees
Polymorphism-ability for object to take many different forms, an extension of inheritance
the idea is using a more base class to do the job of multiple derived classes
polymorphism in APIs
